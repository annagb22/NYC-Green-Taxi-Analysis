# NYC-Green-Taxi-Analysis
Using SQL and Tableau to analyze ridership and revenue of NYC green taxis from 2019-2023

# Problem Statement:
As NYC green taxis are gradually being phased out, ridership has declined, impacting revenue and overall urban mobility. By analyzing NYC green taxi ridership and trip characteristics, we can see how COVID-19 reshaped travel patterns and mobility across neighborhoods.
This project examines…
-Rider behavior over time
-Revenue trends over time
-The impact of COVID 
Goal: To inform planning and decision-making for drivers and city officials

# Why We Care: 
Optimize our current green taxi operations
Provide insights as green taxis potentially merge into other taxi services/rideshare platforms
